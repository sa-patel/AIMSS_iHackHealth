AIMSS:The AI-based Mobile Stroke Scale for 2022 UCSF iHackHealth

In collaboration with Apple, UC Berkeley, UCSF, Peter Hadar MD, Lohith Kini MD

"Purpose
In summary, our first stage for the app is for it to be used by EMTs on arrival to the patient. A stroke scale would be conducted through the AI-enabled AR functionality of the app and, based on the severity, open a secure communication with the nearest stroke-capable center in anticipation of the patientâ€™s arrival. The app would also employ Apple Maps to guide ambulances to the stroke center. 

As of writing this, we did not know how many people would join or the technological backgrounds of the team. Therefore, we drew up several sets of goals that we hope can be accomplished!"
